Lab 1.2 - UDF pattern systems walk through
==========================================

This lab will be primarily Q&A about the UDF pattern, to help familiarize you with the patterns' elements. Feel free to look around.

.. important::
   While you are encouraged to explore, it is not recommended that any configuration changes are made. The only real interactions we will have with the UDF pattern at this stage is to access XRDP or console for the "control / dev" system.
   
Once we have had a chance to discuss the pattern, we will complete the short set of steps below to access the "control / dev" system.

   #. Locate and click on the components tab in the center of the screen.
   #. Locate the system "control / dev".
   #. From the Access drop down menu click the down arrow and select XRDP.

.. note::
   This will attempt to launch an RDP session on your local system.

Alternative access option

   #. An alternative is to simply select the console menu option in leu of the XRDP option.

.. note::
   This will allow you to run the Ubuntu instance right in the browser (This may be a bit slower in some cases.)

.. important::
   On Windows and Mac this should happen automatically. On linux you will need to have an RDP client installed such as Remmina to access the RDP session. If these options do not work feel free to use the alternative console option above 

Recap
-----
You now have the following:

   - Explored the UDP Pattern.
   - Gone through the important elements with the instructor.
   - Accessed the "control / dev" system via RDP or the console option.

Next we'll explore the control / dev system where we will be conducting all of our work.
